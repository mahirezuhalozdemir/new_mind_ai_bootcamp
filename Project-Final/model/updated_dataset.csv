Levora,birth control,"""i was on this pill for almost two years. it does work as far as not getting pregnant however my experience at first was it didn't make a huge difference then 6 or 7 months into it my sex drive went down, along with being very very dry, my moodiness increased drastically. i would cry one second and then get angry with my husband over anything and everything. my skin has gotten a lot worse, i broke out in places i never had in the last week. so now i am on yaz.""",2,"April 16, 2011",-1
Microgestin Fe 1 / 20,acne,"""so i was on ginanvi for about 3 months before i switched over to this pill due to the high cost of ginavi (i don't have insurance). ginanvi had cleared up my acne in the short time i used and i was hoping this birth control would not mess that up. i was wrong. after 2-3 months of using this pill my skin went crazy with horrible breakouts. now, 9 months later i still have horrible acne. if you want a pill that helps with acne this is not it. it also made my period ""weird"". i would have little to no period one month and a heavy one the next . the month that i had a heavier flow my boobs would hurt a lot. i also noticed that at the beginning of taking it , i would be moody and extremely irritable all the time . it's time for me to switch.""",3,"June 22, 2017",-1

-it was much cheaper than anything else. i just had to pay my deductible.
cons:
-i've had my period for what feels like forever. in the beginning, it was just slightly longer than my normal period and slowly increased to where i'm lucky to have 3 days without it in 3 months
-i've had minor hair thinning, nothing noticeable to others

as the morning continued on at 0630, the side effects were evident:
1.	“hot flashes” absolutely miserable. could not get / stay comfortable. firstly, had the flushing sweats, then i would get too cold. turning off the air conditioner and fan for about a half an hour, becoming hot again. this has continued on and has not stopped. extremely bad migraines as well since waking and did not let up at all. sensitive to noise, light and sounds.
2.	the same feeling in my throat upon waking, i drank water to cool off and see if this would stop. and it didn’t.
3.	my face was tingling all over as well.
4.	moderately nauseous upon standing up or sitting down. the nausea had continued all day. had a special k cereal bar to ease this up in the morning. having only relief from it less than an hour.
5.	tried eat cereal for lunch and discovered unable to eat it at all. the taste of it was making me sicker.
6.	took two 500 mg acetaminophen at 0700, relief was only slight and the head aches returned less than two hours.
7.	overall neck pain eased up and other arthritic symptoms did as well. i could definitley tell a difference, however the head ache did not.


8.	decided to take a dosage during the morning at 1000 hrs. to avoid loss of bowel control in my sleep. within about two hours, felt it working through my system. same effects i mentioned as before. severe headaches and nausea all day. and of course unbearable hot & cold feelings again thinking that these should eventually pass as i become used to it.
9.	laid down from 1400 to 1700 to alleviate the symptoms. awoke from the nap and tried to eat dinner. one bite made me sick to my stomach. headaches still there. 
10.	overall, felt the same until bedtime as i did all day. will give it one more try tomorrow morning.

Clonazepam,anxiety,"""yes, this medication works. it works very well for chronic anxiety disorder and  sudden onsets of severe panic attacks. knowing what i know now, i wish with all my being it had never ever been prescribed to me, and without the absurd nonchalance dozens of practitioners have portrayed. 
i'm 32 and have been prescribed clonazopam for 14 years. ive been in situations where my health insurance is in transition and i must go off the medication abruptly-- this is when i realized how deep i was. weeks upon weeks of non stop physical, emotional, and psychological withdrawal effects that are like hell. words cannot accurately describe just how awful it is. this, again, has been my experience during withdrawal as a long term clonazopam patient. 
all skin, especially the face, becomes numb. vision gets fuzzy and difficult to see clearly. panic attacks become extremely exasperated, frequent and debilitating. severe irritability. worst of all: a terrifying disconnection between your mind and body; as if you're an onlooker watching and feeling this horrible thing happen to you, but not actually feeling connected to any of it-- that one is tough to explain. all of this... it can lasts months, maybe more. that's right. not just some one week hump to overcome. 
after finding how awful the withdrawal is i've been attempting to ween very very slowly down from 3 2mg doses per day to eventually zero, hopefully. after six months of gradually decreases in dose i'm now at 2- 1mg doses per day and i'm not sure how or if i can go much less than that. no doctors i've had have been of any help. the ween down was my idea and the rate of it was also my idea based on experience. it sure would be nice to meet a doctor that truly had knowledge of this withdrawal syndrome and took it a bit more seriously. i am confident that the medication is no longer treating my anxiety disorder, but simply preventing withdrawal from the meds themselves. and there don't seem to be any good alternatives. it's a long road ahead, please think it over and over with someone knowledgeable before being so quick to embrace this miracle drug. the truth is that most of us actually need very real psychotherapy, not chemicals that run our lives.

1. this iud does not cause acne, but it lacks estrogen like the pill or other forms of birth control that help with clearing up acne. so you may get more pimples than usual but its what you would normally have with out the pill.

as for side effects - there are side effects to all medication containing hormones, there are simply no exceptions, your hormone levels influence your moods, weight, appearance, everything. there's no way around side effects. i've had long periods and a bit of weight gain, that's it. i can deal with that better than with a baby so hey, i win.""",10,"September 15, 2017",1

the sensation is a bit different than using benzos to stop a panic attack. where ativan will work very quickly in 20-30 minutes tops and smother and separate you from the sensation of panic in your chest, with hydroxyzine it takes about 45 minutes and the way the anxiety slowly petering-out sort of creeps up on you. you have to be more patient which can be awful when you're panicking but the end result is nearly identical.""",8,"February 12, 2017",1

kava has quickly reversed full-blown panic attacks and also markedly reduced pain, probably because of it's direct muscle relaxation. i also sleep like a baby after taking it. but if one is looking for an upfront euphoria (i.e., a recreational drug) then that person is likely to think that kava does nothing.""",10,"July 25, 2016",1

you need to be really careful using it though. use too much and your skin will be peeling for days on end. use only a tiny bit on problem areas and ease yourself onto it.

Isotretinoin,acne,"""​hello everyone,

i'm your typical 18 year old lad and have never written on a forum before but i want to write something for the people that are worried about taking this (in my opinion) miracle drug. i am coming to the end of my 6 month course and i can honestly say it's been life changing. 

before i started roaccutane, i was fairly depressed and seriously lacking confidence due to my appearance. but after months of failed treatments on various antibiotics, i was referred to a dermatologist who instantly said there's only one way to fix my acne problem, roaccutane. at first i thought this is the worst case scenario and i'm going to be even more depressed as a result of the possible mental health side affects. depression has run in my family so i was very worried. however, living like with acne wasn't something i was prepared to do, so i started the course on 40mg a day.

the first week i had a headache daily, but thankfully these die off after a week and paracetamol and ibuprofen will take all the pain away. almost immediately, my lips were cracking and from then on in, i never went anywhere without some carmex lip balm in my pocket.

as the first 3 months went by, i was still breaking out and was starting to think it isn't going to work. however, i'm so glad i stuck with it because now i haven't got a single spot of my face and the scars have faded to the point where you can barely see them! after the third month, my derm upped my dose and i started to take 60mg a day. 

luckily for me i hadn't had any serious side affects. just your occasional nose bleed and dry skin, and sometimes my eyes were a bit blurry but it's not much of an issue.

anyway, i just want anyone reading this that is worried about starting this medication, that not everyone has a horror story about roaccutane and i couldn't be happier at how it's made me feel!!

Acetaminophen / hydrocodone,pain,"""i am 25 years of age, and i am a chronic pain patient. 3 years ago (2009) i began to feel chronic pain all over my body; more and more as time goes on. there isn't a muscle in my body that doesn't hurt. vicodin has saved my life! i've been on 8  5mg tablets daily. were it not for vicodin, my ability to perform everyday tasks would be severely compromised. normal activities whether is mowing the lawn, or even getting out of bed are difficult. my pain level ranges between 5-9. vicodin always takes all the pain away. i highly recommend this medicine if you are seeking relief from chronic pain.

Oxycodone,pain,"""i started taking oxycontin over 3 years ago for chronic pain in my back and left leg and foot. i have peripheral neuropathy, reflex sympathetic dystrophy, sciatic nerve injury, drop foot and have been told i have pinched nerves. all i know is that i have pain. i started taking 40 mg 3 times a day then 80mg twice a day and now my doctor has me on morphine sulphate 100 mg 3 times a day. he said to do this i won't need to continue raising the dose of the oxycontin. the morphine sulphate has not helped as much as the oxycontin.""",7,"May 9, 2009",1
Amitriptyline,pain,"""i had an accident at work 5 years ago. this has caused mid-lower back pain and sciatica on and off for several years. over time the injury has got worse. the pain is now also radiating into my groin area. i take co-codomal 60/1000mg 4 times a day, 500mg naproxen twice daily and now on 30mg of amitriptyline at night after the other medications weren't working.

the pain hasn't gone but it is bearable. on bad days i was unable to walk. since starting the amitriptyline, i have had a couple of side effects. dry mouth and tiredness in the day (however this has got better over time). my quality of life has significantly improved and i can live with the side affects.""",9,"February 7, 2017",1
Hydromorphone,pain,"""it is helpful in neck and spine and helps the pain in my spine and neck and helps me be able to relax without constantly having to move in odd places to sleep and sit. therefore i found that this helps with little side effects unlike other pain medication that i've been prescribed in the past.""",10,"July 22, 2013",1
Fentanyl,pain,"""very effective for pain. have been pain meds for 11 yrs. tried many others ie. hydrocodone, morphine, percocet, oxymorphone, several others, but nothing worked like fentanyl. however, i have had some serious side effects. first i froze at 78 degrees inside our home in southwest florida. then my left eye started getting really hazy. i thought my glasses were filthy. by the way it's still hazy after going through almost four months of withdrawal.  then my right leg felt like dead weight at night. my left leg felt like it was wrapped with a very tight sock from below the knee to my ankle. i felt like i was going to vomit any minute, my mouth started to get watery. my gut hurt like anything.

Fentanyl,pain,"""i sympathize with the anonymous user who has been on the patch for only one month (comments dated 4/24). i have been on this patch for 8-10 years now. sadly ... long story short, i went through a lot in the beginning too. i am one of the small percentage of people who needed to change the patch every 48 hours instead of 72 because i was experiencing severe withdrawal symptoms (which is what you are describing) whenever i waited 72 hours. the 48 hours made a difference. however, it isn't a perfect system, there are problems, sweating it off during summer, no more pool, etc. it's not perfect and breakthrough medicines are needed in my case. long-term use gets tricky, be careful and good luck.""",7,"April 29, 2009",1
Oxymorphone,pain,"""after being on 80 mg of oxycontin 3 times a day i wasn't getting the pain relief. i went thru breakthroughs and my insurance would only cover generic oxy. saw a new pain doc and the nurse practitioner switched me to opana, only 30 mg twice a day. my breakthrough meds stay locked up unless i'm doing something special. i always take opana with food (instructions say take on an empty stomach) as i found taking taking it with food makes it last longer. due to insurance i had to switch tot 15 mg, 2 tabs, twice a day. i found this give me some flexibility. if i'm having a tough day i may take one around 5 pm and then only one at bedtime. medicare sucks though. i hit the gap about 6 months ago and found out i have to pay 4,800+ til it's done.""",9,"April 20, 2016",1

Acetaminophen / hydrocodone,pain,"""it does the job of pacifying my gout and arthritis pain well. it does however come with the traditional side effects; you build up a tolerance, it can make it hard to focus, it will make you sleepy, and once you come off it you will likely have withdrawal for 3-5 days and it will cost you sleep.""",8,"October 12, 2017",1

Oxycodone,pain,"""i had to go onto oxycodone as i became allergic to buprenorphine patches & reached the limit of how much morphine i could tolerate.  with oxycodone my pain relief is better than morphine, the migraines are still a problem but less 'sharp' than when i took morphine.
as i live in england i am able to take oxycodone as an extended release drug called 'targinact'.  it is a combination of oxycodone but also naloxone, which elimintes the biggest problem with opiates.....constipation.  targinact works amazingly well - i can take oxycodone in high doses but with no constipation.  it is a shame that it isn't available in the us.  although it is more expensive than oxycodone, all my prescriptions are free thanks to our wonderful healthcare system.""",10,"December 16, 2010",1
